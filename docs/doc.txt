ethOS-update-manager : ethuper



In the following text or in files / scripts, ethOS-update-manager will be replaced by ethuper which stands for ETHos UPdate managER.

DESCRIPTION

ethOS-update-manager is complete solution deisgned to run, log, manage and reboot (if needed) automaticly yours miners.

Two main features are runing / managing results from cmd update or show stats, logging it in a readable way, and providing a complete automatic reboot manager to prevent overwarming, gpu failure and under performance issues by rebooting (hard or soft way), allowing and/or restarting miner.

As a log/performance manager, it is designed to provide good and helpful data information, and to help miners to improve their productivity by tuning in an easier way their local.conf.

As a rebooting manager, it is designed to provide a clever solution to increase uptime by rebooting, allowing, restarting with specific strategy for each problem.

Every log, reboot, allow or restart option is handly configurable with the ethuper command. See bellow or doc/ for dull information.

It is designed to be run directly from the device to avoid ssh breaking connection problem (common with ethOS 1.2.7 and 1.2.9)

You're free to use update or show stats command, but as update push data to the server for each call, it is recommanded to use show stats.
